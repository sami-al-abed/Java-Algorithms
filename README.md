# Java Algorithms
Algorithms I am playing with in Java<br/><br/>
This will be added onto as I play with and try to implement more algorithms!<br/>
Feel free to use thes for anything but cheating :)<br/><br/>
The following algorithms are shown in this repo:<br/>
- Insertion Sort<br/>
  - Time complexity O(n^2)<br/>
  - Space complexity O(1)<br/>
- Selection Sort<br/>
  - Time complexity O(n^2)<br/>
  - Space complexity O(1)<br/>
- Bubble Sort<br/>
  - Time complexity O(n^2)<br/>
  - Space complexity O(1)<br/>
- Merge Sort<br/>
  - Time complexity O(nlog(n))<br/>
  - Space complexity O(n)<br/>
- Quick Sort<br/>
  - Time complexity O(nlog(n)) on average, but O(n^2) in worst case<br/>
  - Space complexity O(1)<br/>
